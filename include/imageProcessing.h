    // TODO: Create a class that can take in an image and
    //           A.) Resize an image. Meaning you can pass a value x and y that the image will resize to
    //               as long as those values do not exceed the size of the image.
    //           B.) Convert the image to grayscale given "n" number of bits. For example, if passed 4 bits for the "color",
    //               this will make it so that each "pixel" gets 4 bits for a brightness value.
